# ### Practical Exercises

# #1. **Print Statement**

# print("Hello, World!")


# #2. **Variable Assignment**

# x = 10
# y = "Python"
# print(x)
# print(y)


# #3. **Data Types**
# #   - Create variables of different data types and print their values.

# name = "Alice"
# age = 30
# height = 5.4
# is_student = True

# print("Name:", name)
# print("Age:", age)
# print("Height:", height)
# print("Is student:", is_student)


# ### Combining Data Types and Print

# #1. **String Concatenation**
#    #- Combine strings using the `+` operator.


# first_name = "John"
# last_name = "Doe"
# full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
# print("Full Name:", full_name)


# #2. **Formatted Strings**
#    #- Use formatted strings for more readable output (available in Python 3.6 and later).


# name = "Alice"
# age = 30
# height = 5.4

# print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Height: {height}")


# ### Practice Problems

# #1. Write a program that stores your name, age, and favorite color in variables and prints them in a sentence.


# name = "Alice"
# age = 30
# favorite_color = "blue"

# print(f"My name is {name}, I am {age} years old, and my favorite color is {favorite_color}.")


# #2. Write a program that calculates the sum of two numbers and prints the result.


# num1 = 10
# num2 = 20
# sum = num1 + num2
# print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum)
